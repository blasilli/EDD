# EDD

A Web-Based Editor for Declarative Process Models Using [easyDeclare](https://github.com/blasilli/easyDeclare).

In process mining, declarative process discovery aims to extract declarative process models from event logs. Declare is a declarative process modeling language that provides an extensible set of standard templates for modeling declarative processes imposing temporal constraints on the sequence of process activities. The easyDeclare graphical notation has recently been developed to represent Declare models. This graphical notation has been proven to enhance human understandability of declarative process discovery results and reduce the cognitive load required to interpret these models compared to the original Declare graphical notation. We present EDD, a web-based editor for declarative process models using the easyDeclare notation. Researchers and practitioners in the process mining field have evaluated the usability of EDD, resulting in a high usability rating. The tool can be used directly within a web browser or by cloning its GitHub repository. As an open-source project, EDD is available to the research community for use and further improvement.
